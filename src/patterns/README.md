## Patterns

Patterns make up ALL the components of this website. Patterns are categorized per the Atom design philosophy (https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

### Categories:

-   Atoms (buttons etc)
-   Molecules
-   Organisms (repeatable sections)
-   Templates

### Within each atomic category, sub-categories exists as follows:

-   Base (shared between default and custom blocks)
-   Custom (components we create for our clients. Custom per project)
-   Default (components that are provided to all of our clients. Only inherit global styles)
-   Sample (Rarely used. Available to show developers how to implement certain custom components)
